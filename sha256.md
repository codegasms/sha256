## The Unicode Codepoint To UTF-8 Conversion

```Unicode``` is represented as ```U+XXXX```, where ```XXXX``` is a hexadecimal number. ```UTF-8``` is a direct mapping of the unicode characters i.e. Encoding format of Unicode characters in one-byte units, hence the suffix ```-8```, more specifically it is a conversion of a codepoint into a set of one to four bytes.

1. **Range 1 [0xxxxxxx]**

    Out of the available 8-bits, 1-bit is reserved to show that this is of Type-1 UTF-8 i.e. one-byte encoding. The rest of the bits i.e. 7-bits can be used to map $2^7 = 128$ numbers.

    _e.g._ ```U+0047 (Unicode of 'A')``` is mapped as [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]

    > This contains the mappings of ASCII characters (0-127)

2. **Range 2 [110xxxxx] [10xxxxxx]**

    Out of the available 16-bits, first 3-bits of the first byte are reserved to show that this is of Type-2 UTF-8 i.e. two-byte encoding. This is shown by using two 1s and a 0. The first 2-bits of the second byte are also reserved to denote the same thing. To avoid ambiguity in memory access, both the bytes have some reserved bits to denote the type of UTF-8 range. The rest of the bits i.e. 5-bits from the first byte and the 6-bits from the second byte can be used to map $2^{(5+6)} = 2^{11} = 2048$ numbers.

    _e.g._ ```U+00B9 (Unicode of '$^1$')``` is mapped as [1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0] [1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1]

    > This contains the mappings of unicode characters (128-2047)

3. **Range 3 [1110xxxx] [10xxxxxx] [10xxxxxx]**

    Out of the available 24-bits, first 4-bits of the first byte are reserved to show that this is of Type-3 UTF-8 i.e. three-byte encoding. This is shown by using three 1s and a 0. The first 2-bits of the second byte and third byte are also reserved to denote the same thing. To avoid ambiguity in memory access, all the bytes have some reserved bits to denote the type of UTF-8 range. The rest of the bits i.e. 5-bits from the first byte and the 6-bits from the second byte & third byte can be used to map $2^{(4+6+6)} = 2^{16} = 65536$ numbers.

    _e.g._ ```U+2070 (Unicode of '$^0$')``` is mapped as [1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0] [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1] [1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]

    > This contains the mappings of unicode characters (2048-65535)

4. **Range 4 [11110xxx] [10xxxxxx] [10xxxxxx] [10xxxxxx]**

    Out of the available 32-bits, first 5-bits of the first byte are reserved to show that this is of Type-4 UTF-8 i.e. four-byte encoding. This is shown by using four 1s and a 0. The first 2-bits of the second byte, third byte and fourth byte are also reserved to denote the same thing. To avoid ambiguity in memory access, all the bytes have some reserved bits to denote the type of UTF-8 range. The rest of the bits i.e. 5-bits from the first byte and the 6-bits from the second byte, third byte & fourth byte can be used to map $2^{(3+6+6+6)} = 2^{21} = 2097152$ numbers.

    > This contains the mappings of unicode characters (65536-2097151),  but we have not yet reached the upper-bound yet. Range 4 is (65536-1114111) as of today. _(Discalimer : This data is prone to changes on a regular basis, check the Unicode website for more information)_
